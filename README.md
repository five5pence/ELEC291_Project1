Welcome to the ELEC 291 Project 1 git!

In theory, this should allow us to collaborate on the code portion of Project 1.

You will need to install (if not already installed):
 - GitHub Desktop
 - Git

To get started, clone the repo with GitHub Desktop with the green "<>Code" Button and Select "Open with GitHub Desktop".

Then you should be able to open the repo in vscode and push/pull changes as necessary.
